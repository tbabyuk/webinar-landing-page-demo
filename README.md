# Real Estate Webinar Landing Page

See it live: [Webinar Landing Page](https://golden-churros-0f78d2.netlify.app/)

## Description
This is a webinar registration landing page that I had done for a real-estate client. It provides visitors with information about the webinar and allows them to register by entering their name and email address. After they register, they receive a zoom link that they can use to join the webinar. The webinar organizer (my client) receives an email to their mailbox with the name and email of each registrant, which was accomplished on the back end with Nodemailer.

## Technologies
The current version of this project was done with:
* Next.js
* Tailwind CSS
* React
* Node.js
* Nodemailer

## State of Completion
Completed.

## Learning Lessons & Challenges

### APIs in Next.js
This small project gave me a chance to work with Route Handlers in Next.js, which was a fun challenge as I had mostly worked on the front-end before. I had to create an API route to process the form data, email the registrant's information to my client, and then send a response back to the front end.

### Nodemailer
Although I had heard about Nodemailer before, I never really got a chance to use it until this project. It's a neat little tool that works very well for sending emails.

## Summary
I really enjoyed making this little project and am especially happy with the layout and the general look I was able to achieve. For the layout, I was working from a print ad that the client provided to me and was told to imitate it as much as possible for the landing page, which is what I did and was very happy with the result!
